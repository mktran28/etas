# Epidemic-Type Aftershock (ETAS) Model Visualization

An educational web page that explains the **Epidemic-Type Aftershock (ETAS)** model and its application to **predictive policing**.  

The project focuses on making a mathematically non-trivial model understandable through clear structure, notation, and visual layout.

## Overview

This project includes:

- A **high-level introduction** to predictive policing and its real-world context  
- An **algorithm-focused breakdown** of the ETAS model
- A **clear explanation of the underlying mathematics and logic**, consisting of:
  - Crime intensity modeling as a time-dependent function
  - Separation of **background events** and **triggered events**
  - Parameter estimation using the **Expectation-Maximization (EM) algorithm**
  - How iterative updates converge toward stable model parameters

This project aims to:

- Translate **academic and algorithmic models** into clear, developer-friendly explanations  
- Reason about **probabilistic systems, temporal processes, and iterative algorithms**  
- Emphasize structured thinking around how mathematical models are implemented and evaluated in software systems
